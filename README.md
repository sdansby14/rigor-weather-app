## Challenges Completed

a. Retrieve the current weather details for a location of your choice from the
OpenWeatherMap API. ✅\
b. Display the weather information to the user, optionally using the mockup. ✅\
c. Submit to a public GitHub repo that includes instructions to run your project locally. ✅

#### Bonus Points:

a. Display a graph that shows the temperature forecast for the next few hours (feel
free to use any Charting library or plugin such as D3, Highcharts, Recharts, etc.) ❌\
b. Display the 5-day forecast in addition to the current weather. (OpenWeather has a
7 day forecast so I used that instead of the 5 day forecast.) ✅\
c. Instead of choosing a location, use the built-in browser Geolocation API to retrieve the
user’s location and use that to display the weather details where the user is located. It
may be helpful to use a geocode tool like OpenCage. ✅
